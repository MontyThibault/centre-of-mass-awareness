- Introduction
==============
  Thank you for purchasing this product.

  The following description is a supplementary explanation for API-AIO(WDM).
  Please refer to Online Help(APITOOL.CHM) for how to use API-AIO(WDM).


- Notes
=======
  API-AIO(WDM) is different from the earlier editions of analog I/O driver.
  Please refer to Online Help(API-AIO(WDM).CHM) for the difference.

  About compiling the C++ Builder samples
  If the path contaiins "-"(hyphen), the C++ Builder will fail in the building.
  If API-AIO(WDM) has been installed by default,
  it can not be used "as is" because "API-PAC(W32)" is included
  in the path.
  You should first copy the folder that include the sample project to a path
  not containing the hyphen and then build it.

  In the following case, the buffer for bus master is limited to maximum 1M Byte.

  <a PC has the memory more than 4G Byte>
  In Windows 64 bit OS and Windows 32 bit OS, PAE (Physical Address Extension) is enabled.

  <a PC has the memory less than 4G Byte>
  In Windows 64 bit OS or Windows 32 bit OS, PAE (Physical Address Extension) is enabled, 
  and [Memory Reclaiming] functionality is enabled by BIOS setting of the PC (matherboard) 
  in which a board is plugged.

  * According to PC (motherboard), there is the case that [Memory Reclaiming] functionality 
  cannot be changed to Enabled/Disabled by BIOS setting, therefore, please confirm in advance.
