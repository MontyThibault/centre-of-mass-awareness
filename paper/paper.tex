\subsection{Physically-Based Animation Systems}

Traditional character animation systems used in film \& games rely artist-driven keyframing techniques. While proven to be effective, keyframing is known to be time-consuming and highly dependent on the skill of the artist.

\subsection{Human Sensory Awareness}

Significant study has been done in the field of neuroscience on the brain's representation of the human body. This topic has been coined various names self-attribution \cite{2010-TOG-gbwc}, the brain-body model \cite{}, and ... . However, there has not been a call to quantify this work into representations that can recreate convincing human motor error; integration into physically-based character animation systems may be a unique use-case in this instance.
